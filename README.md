# Video-Video-and-Video-Text-Summarization
This repository contains V2VT, a multimodal video summarization pipeline that generates video and text summaries using visual, audio, and textual features extracted from raw videos.  The project is designed as a research‑style implementation for TVSum /SumMe datasets, with a focus on both quantitative evaluation and qualitative visualizations.
